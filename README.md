# TakeFive

================================================================================

**Why are we doing this?**

I have chosen to share this project as a way of demonstrating and showcasing some of the fundamental skills and techniques I have learnt. 
My project solidifies and puts into practice the knowledge I have acquired through training in multiple technologies such as;

	* Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira)
	* Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (H2, MySQL)
	* Programming Fundamentals (Java)
	* API Development (Spring Boot)
	* Automated Testing (JUnit, Mockito)

=================================================================================

**How I expected the challenge to go**

I expected the challenge to be relatively straightforward in terms of meeting the minimum viable product. 
After that I didn't expect the creation of another table and entity class to be a problem.
The main challenge I saw was in linking the two tables and classes together and writing the logic required for the user to interact successfully with the application.
I was also cautious of the testing phase as I felt this represented a challenge to me, so I planned to allocate more time towards testing.

================================================================================

**What went well? / What didn't go as planned?**

The creation of the person and task class were straightforward as I had expected. I was able to push my changes to github using a main, develop, feature branch structure.
My jira board was very useful in helping keeping me on track with prioritisation and I used a jira calendar workflow to plan my days ahead.

I encountered some issues with unit testing my update methods but this was solved my using the Mockito.any object.
Linking the tables together was quite complicated and would involve the use of mapping, so this is something that I will have to push into the next sprint. 

================================================================================

**Possible improvements for future revisions of the project**

I plan to continue working on the project. I would firstly like to implement the features I could not fit into my sprint such as a function which updates level meters.

Then looking further ahead I would like to add; 

	* an accept / skip task function
	* a more varied task reward system that rewards points to multiple categories
	* a way to spend your coins on rewards from a shop (e.g. fun tasks)
	* a timer function
	* a feature that asks for your interests and tailors the tasks to suit
	* a frontend GUI

**Risk assessment**

	* Disk failure or any issues with laptop - loss of work risk mitigated by regular pushes to GitHub.
	* Complete failure or loss of working device - risk mitigated by having access to a backup machine and github repo.
	* Repetetive strain injury in eyes, hands, shoulders, back - taking regular breaks away from the screen, walking, stretching and moving, wearing glasses and comfortable posture.
 	* Poor time management - i stay on top of this risk by using a jira board, calendar and reminders app on my phone to schedule tasks for the week, day and hours ahead.
	* Procrastination - the use of a daily to do list with alarms keeps me on track, if there is anything i become really stuck on, I will move on to something else and come back later.
	* Stress - becoming stressed or exhausted by overworking is a risk. I reduce this by not working past a set time, getting a good nights sleep and continuing with activities outside the project.
